## Connecto.rs

This is connect-4 with a Rust core compiled to WASM, wrapped in Typescript, rendered in HTML.

The goal is to bait more Javascript-ies to write Rust.
Demonstrating the `why` of writing Rust is outside the scope of this repository, demonstrating all the great things you can do with Rust is also outside the scope as I am in no way an authority on writing idiomatic Rust.

But if you're already curious about Rust, hopefully this repository will speed up the process of going from `whaaa` to `whoaa`.

May the connect-4s be with you.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (for running the web-server)
- Rust toolchain (for running the Rust code)
- wasm-pack (for compiling to WASM)
